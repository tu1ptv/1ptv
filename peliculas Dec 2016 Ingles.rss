      <description><![CDATA[1981. Barack Obama (Devon Terrell), known as Barry, arrives in New York City. He is expected to attend Columbia University. Unfortunately, the first night in New York is not what it seems. Unable to contact his expected roommate, Will, Barry spends the night in the streets. As a new day begins, Barack succeeds to find a young man he met at a party a few months back, Saleem, who welcomes him in his apartment. Barry then meets Raquel, a woman who seems to have spent the night with Saleem. Later, Barry meets his roommate Will and they both begin to live in their apartment, off-campus, on 109th street. As they are walking to class, Barry meets his neighbors when one of them asks for a cigarette. In class, Barry is soon revealed to be a great student. He seems interested in philosophy and has many opinions about American society around him. While trying to fit into New York, he is unaware of what he has to do to feel accepted. During his political science class, Barry meets Charlotte (Anya Taylor-Joy), a nice girl who seems to have an interest for debates. When he is not in class, Barry is playing basketball.

While playing basketball, Barry soon gets nicknamed "The Invisible Man" by Eddie, a graduate student who grew up in the Grants Houses in Harlem and is a graduate student at Columbia. Later that night, Will and Barry both attend a frat party at Columbia where they see Charlotte again. In an attempt to leave the party, both Charlotte and Barry go to a club downtown where they form a closer connection and begin to date. The next day, Charlotte and Barry watch a political debate on TV. While Barry is inattentive about politics and declares his love really lies in art, Charlotte tells him it's his "civic duty" to care about politics and their nation. Eventually, they start hooking up. As their love interest grows, Barry continues to wonder about his place in society, New York, and the condition of other black people in the city. The next day Charlotte and Barry go on a date in Central Park, and later that day after playing basketball within Columbia, Barry grabs lunch with one of his basketball friends, Eddie, who tells him he's majoring in finance and hopes to work at the New York Stock Exchange in Wall Street. Around Thanksgiving, at a bar with Barry and Saleem, Charlotte asks Barry to meet her parents. Barry refuses and Charlotte then asks him to meet them later on at her sister's wedding. Finally, Barry accepts. After going back to Saleem's apartment, Charlotte and Barry are surprised to find Barry's mother, Ann Dunham (Ashley Judd), there. Charlotte asks a lot of questions to Ann about Barry's father and childhood as she is frustrated that Barry kept so much of his private life to himself. That night, Barry and his mom see a movie and walk around Central Park where he discloses to her that he is unsure about his place in New York and where he feels he should belong. The next day, Barry and Charlotte are walking in a black neighborhood when Barry begins to feels uncomfortable as people are surprised he's with a white girl. At lunch this anxious feeling continues as Barry explains to Charlotte that everybody is looking at him. They have an argument which ends with Charlotte saying to Barry that she loves him. Barry, surprised, only responds "thank you", then leaves to go play basketball.

The following day, Barry is invited by Eddie and the people in his basketball group to attend a party in Harlem. At the party, Barry learns about New York's housing projects and the treatment reserved to the lower classes. Barry also meets an attractive woman named Denise and is then punched in the face by Denise's boyfriend, who thought that Barry was attempting to seduce her. As Barry leaves the party drunk, he returns back to campus only to be racially-profiled and asked to show his ID to confirm he's a student. Barry begins to get heated with the security, but Thad, a white-boy from his political science class who is openly holding a beer can, stops him. Frustrated by Thad's personality and his lack of acknowledgement of the double-standards around him, Barry calls Thad an asshole and then goes to Charlotte's apartment where he attempts to hook-up with her. Charlotte refuses when she sees the wound on his face and tries to comfort him. While sitting on her bed looking at pictures she took of him, Barry gets in a fight with Charlotte and questions their relationship until Charlotte goes to sleep and leaves him alone. A few days later on the day of Charlotte's sister's wedding, Barry receives a phone call. He learns that his father has died in a car accident (1982). Shocked, Barry doesn't talk to Charlotte about it while they are on their way to her sister's wedding and becomes very closed off when Charlotte tries to understands what Barry is keeping to himself. At the wedding, Barry is welcomed by Charlotte's parents and enjoys a nice dinner with them. Barry explains his early life to Charlotte's parents – his mixed race parents, their backgrounds, and his living situation in Hawaii, Indonesia and California, but Charlotte feels closed-off as Barry rarely discloses anything personal to her. Later at the wedding, while they're dancing, it is assumed Barry breaks up with Charlotte or simply leaves her on the dance floor; he then enjoys a cigarette outside and reads the letter he was going to send to his father as he was finally trying to contact him. A few days later, Barry is playing basketball where he meets a young boy who looks like him, and together they play HORSE.]]></description>
